    "#### Answer: To move values from an initial index to another index, such as at the end of the list, is actually a challenging thing to do elegently. One of the reasons is that pop() - the function for deleting a value in a list, automatically shifts the entire list to the left. If a normal loop was involved, it would iterate and miss elements due to the fact that the entire list was shifted when a value/index was \"poped\" out of it's initial spot."

The elegent two pointer solution are two terative loops that aren't nested.
